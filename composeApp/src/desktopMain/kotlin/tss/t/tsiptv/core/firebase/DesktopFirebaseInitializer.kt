/**
 * Desktop (macOS) Firebase initializer.
 * 
 * This class provides a way to access Firebase services from Kotlin code for desktop (macOS) applications.
 * For desktop applications, Firebase integration is more complex and may require different approaches:
 * 
 * 1. Using Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
 * 2. Using Firebase REST APIs
 * 3. Using Firebase Web SDK through JavaFX WebView
 * 
 * This implementation provides in-memory implementations for simplicity, but in a real app,
 * you would implement one of the approaches above.
