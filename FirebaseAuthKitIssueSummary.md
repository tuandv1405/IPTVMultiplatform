# Firebase Auth Kit Issue Summary

## Issue

The error message:
```
/Users/tun/Tun/ComposeMultiPlatform/iosApp/Framworks/FirebaseAuthKit/<unknown>:1:1 missing required module 'GoogleUtilities_NSData'
```

This error occurs when trying to build or use the FirebaseAuthKit framework because it's missing a dependency on the GoogleUtilities_NSData module, which is part of the Firebase iOS SDK.

## Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that the FirebaseAuthKit framework is not properly configured to include all the necessary Firebase dependencies. Specifically:

1. The GoogleUtilities package, which contains the GoogleUtilities_NSData module, is not properly included in the framework's dependencies.
2. The framework's build settings may not be correctly configured to link all the necessary Firebase modules.
3. The framework search paths may not include the paths to all required frameworks.

## Solution

A comprehensive solution has been provided in the form of:

1. **FirebaseAuthKitSetupGuide.md**: A step-by-step guide for setting up the FirebaseAuthKit framework with all the necessary Firebase dependencies, including GoogleUtilities_NSData.

2. **TestFirebaseAuthKit.sh**: A script to test if the FirebaseAuthKit framework is properly set up according to the guide.

The key steps to resolve this issue are:

1. Create the FirebaseAuthKit framework project in Xcode
2. Add Firebase dependencies, including GoogleUtilities which contains GoogleUtilities_NSData
3. Configure the framework with the appropriate build settings
4. Ensure all Firebase dependencies are properly linked
5. Build the framework for both device and simulator
6. Set up Kotlin/Native interop to generate bindings for the framework

## Alternative Approach

If creating a separate framework continues to cause issues, an alternative approach is to:

1. Add the FirebaseAuthBridge.swift file directly to the iOS app project
2. Ensure Firebase dependencies are properly added to the iOS app project
3. Use Kotlin/Native interop to generate bindings directly for the iOS app's modules

This approach may be simpler and avoid some of the complexities of creating a separate framework.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always ensure that all required dependencies are properly included when creating a framework
2. Check the framework's build settings to ensure all modules are properly linked
3. Test the framework thoroughly before integrating it into the main project
4. Keep the Swift code simple and avoid complex features that don't translate well to Objective-C
5. Use explicit imports in Swift code to make dependencies clear
